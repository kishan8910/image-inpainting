inpaintGrayImage.m	- main program
OnionPeel.m		- for peeling the pixels from fillfront
Neighbours.m		- for extracting the neighbouring patches
SimilarityMeasure.m	- for find the similarity between patches (in the paper its denoted by Rho)
distance.m		- for calculating distance between patches (which is used in the equation for finding  Wppj)
WPPj.m			- for finding the Wppj value corresponding to all the j's (its output is a vector)
wppj.m			- for finding the Wppj value for one j (Its output is value)
PsiT.m			- Psit value as in the equation 9 in the literature.
Dmatirx.m		- D value as in equation 9
Epsilon.m		- epsilon value as in the equation 8
Alpha.m			- alpha value using the equation 15 in the literature	

[I the drop menu 'select coordinates for inpainting'- you have to give the 
X1 -- row1
X2 -- row2
Y1 -- col1
Y2 -- col2
values, as shown i the figure. And you will get a square patch.]
